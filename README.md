# Back to Testing

Repository created for the meet up "Back to Testing" organised by the London Software Craftmaship.
Here is the description:

Let's test-drive some code.

Here are the rules: we're going to build some software, and we're going to drive it from the acceptance tests first. This session, we'll use a BDD framework (like Cucumber, for example) to flesh out requirements and drive functionality. Your product owner will help you figure out what you're building and make sure you're on the right track.

If you're looking for more, then we've got you covered. Optionally, you can also practice Object Calisthenics. This one's for the brave. Here are the rules, in case you're curious right now:

- One level of indentation per method 
- Don't use the ELSE keyword 
- Wrap all primitives and Strings
- First class collections
- One dot per line 
- Don't abbreviate 
- Keep all entities small (50 lines max) 
- No classes with more than two instance variables
- No getters/setters/properties
